# Apartment Checklist Full Stack Project
Full stack project to learn Angular. Frontend uses Angular and the backend uses SQL and Java.

I'm moving into a new apartment for school and thought it'd be fun to base the project around planning what to purchase for the new apartment.

**Current Plan**

To let the user list tenants and assign tenants to purchase items. 

I want to include a feature that splits cost among any number of tenants to easily calculate how much each person should pay.
